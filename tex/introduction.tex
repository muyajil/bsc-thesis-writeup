\section{Introduction}
To protect the confidentiality of sensitive information stored in databases, it is essential to restrict access to the data.
%
For this, the SQL standard defines an access control model, and existing Database Management Systems (DBMSs) have accordingly implemented it. 
%
One of the main tasks of database access control mechanisms is to check whether \texttt{SELECT} queries issued by the users are secure.
%
This is \emph{essential} to effectively secure database systems and prevent the leakage of sensitive information.

The access control mechanism implemented in PostgreSQL is rather simple.
%
It just analyzes the syntax of submitted \texttt{SELECT} queries.
%
Namely, a \texttt{SELECT} query is deemed secure if all the tables and views referenced in it are readable to the user issuing the query, according to the access control policy.
%
This mechanism is overly restrictive.
%
Indeed, as already identified in~\cite{...}, even queries not satisfying this criterion are secure.

Recently, Guarnieri et al.~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} investigated the limitations of this access control model. 
%
They developed a novel, more secure, access control mechanism.
%
This access control mechanism shows that sub-routines for checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} queries are also one of the main building blocks of strong access control mechanisms such as the one proposed.
%
The mechanism however also requires that these routines are more permissive and efficient, to keep the overall database system still usable.
%
Motivated by this Guarnieri et al. developed such a routine for checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} statements.

The routine proposed in~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} however, has two main practical limitations.
%
First, it is based on the relational calculus, whereas existing DBMSs are based on SQL. Despite SQL being inspired by the relational calculus it differs from it in significant ways. For instance, they differ in their syntax and semantics, e.g., SQL uses a bag semantics whereas the relational calculus relies on a set-based semantics.
%
Second, it is defined primarily for boolean queries, whereas \texttt{SELECT} queries usually retrieve tuples.
%
Even though boolean queries can be used to encode the result of non-boolean queries, this encoding may introduce a extreme blow-up in the formula's size.

Motivated by the idea of extending the mechanism from~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} to the entire SQL language, in this thesis we develop a novel algorithm for checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} queries.
%
Our algorithm extends the one proposed by Guarnieri et al. to the SQL language and is more permissive than the one implemented in PostgreSQL.

{\bf Contributions.}
%
Due to the gravity of the current situation, where the mentioned attacks can cause severe damage, this thesis explores the possibility of preventing confidentiality attacks in PostgreSQL, a widely used DBMS.
%
First, we refactor the original PostgreSQL's implementation to isolate the access control mechanism and provide a general interface for access requests, independent of the type of query.
%
The original implementation requires a deep understanding of the backend architecture of PostgreSQL to be able to extend and improve the current access control algorithm.
%
Our refactoring provides the possibility of improving and extending access control without interfering with the internals of the DBMS.

Second, we extend the access control mechanism proposed by Guarnieri et al.~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} to SQL.
%
This is essential to effectively secure PostgreSQL and prevent leakages of sensitive information.
%
In more detail, we implemented a new access control mechanism for \texttt{SELECT} queries, which, as mentioned before, represents the first building block of successfully implementing the access control mechanism proposed by Guarnieri et al.
%
\remark{
As shown in our experiments, our mechanism introduces an overhead, on average, of XX\%, in contrast to Guarnieri et al.'s mechanism  that  has an overhead of ...X\cite{guarnieri2016strong}.

{\bf Organization.}
%
In chapter 2 we will introduce some motivating examples.
%
In chapter 3 we will give background information to access control by comparing current access control mechanism to the model introduced in~\cite{guarnieri2016strong}.
%
After that we will introduce the architecture of PostgreSQL and the new access control algorithm in chapter 4. 
%
In chapter 5 we will begin by showing the formal models of all aspects of the new security defintions and how they are extended from the relational algebra to SQL. 
%
Furthermore we will conduct experiments with state-of-the-art benchmark databases and queries in chapter 6. 
%
In chapter 7 we will introduce some related work to the thesis. 
%
Finally in chapter 8 the conclusions are drawn and future possibilities are discussed.
