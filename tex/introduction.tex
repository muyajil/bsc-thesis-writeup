\section{Introduction}
To protect the confidentiality of sensitive information stored in databases, it is essential to restrict access to the stored data.
%
For this, the SQL standard defines an access control model, and existing Database Management Systems (DBMSs) have accordingly implemented it. 
%
One of the main tasks of database access control mechanisms is to determine whether \texttt{SELECT} queries issued by the users are secure.
%
This is \emph{essential} to effectively secure database systems and prevent the leakage of sensitive information.

The access control mechanism proposed in the SQL standard, and implemented in the PostgreSQL DBMS, is rather simple.
%
It relies on syntactic checks to determine whether the submitted \texttt{SELECT} query is secure.
%
In more detail, a \texttt{SELECT} query $q$ is deemed secure if the user issuing $q$ is authorized to read, according to the access control policy, all the tables and views referenced in $q$. % are readable to , according to the access control policy.
%
This mechanism is overly restrictive.
%
Indeed, as already noticed in~\cite{guarnieri2014optimal,rizvi2004extending, wang2007correctness,zhang2005authorizations}, even queries not satisfying this criterion are secure.

Recently, Guarnieri et al.~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} investigated the limitations of SQL's access control model and  developed a novel, more secure, access control mechanism.
%
The main building block of this mechanism is an algorithm for checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} queries.
%
This algorithm is used not only to decide whether \texttt{SELECT} queries are authorized or not, but also to determine whether all the other commands may leak sensitive information. 
%
The use of naive and restrictive algorithms, such as those proposed in the SQL standard, as a building block for novel strong access control mechanisms would result in an extremely unusable system.
%
Motivated by this, Guarnieri et al. developed a more permissive algorithm, based on query rewriting, for checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} queries.

The algorithm proposed in~\cite{guarnieri2016strong}, however, has two main practical limitations.
%
First, it is based on the relational calculus, whereas existing DBMSs are based on SQL. Despite SQL being inspired by the relational calculus, the former differs from the latter in significant ways. For instance, SQL has a different syntax and semantics, e.g., it uses a bag semantics whereas the relational calculus relies on a set-based semantics.
%
Second, it is defined primarily for boolean queries, whereas \texttt{SELECT} queries usually retrieve tuples.
%
Even though boolean queries can be used to encode the result of non-boolean queries, this encoding may introduce an exponential blow-up in the formula's size.

Motivated by the idea of extending the mechanism from~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} to the entire SQL language, in this thesis we develop a novel algorithm for checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} queries.
%
Our algorithm extends the one proposed by Guarnieri et al. to the SQL language and is more permissive than the one proposed in the SQL standard and  implemented in PostgreSQL.

{\bf Contributions.}
Existing database access control mechanisms are not secure~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} . 
%
Therefore Guarnieri et al. have devised a new access control mechanism, based on the relational calculus, that successfully prevents attacks that thwart existing access control mechanisms.
%
This access control mechanism requires a more permissive way to authorize \texttt{SELECT} queries.
%
Motivated by the idea of extending Guarnieri et al.'s mechanism~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} to the entire SQL language,  we made the following contributions.

First, we refactored the original the implementation of PostgreSQL, a widely used and open source DBMS.
%
For this, we isolated the access control mechanism from the rest of the codebase and implemented a general interface for access requests, independant of the type of query. \remark{access requests is undefined.}
%
The original PostgreSQL's implementation requires a deep understanding of the backend architecture of DBMS to be able to extend and improve the current access control mechanism.
%
Developers can use the refactored version of PostgreSQL to implement new, stronger access control mechanisms, without needing to modify the internals of PostgreSQL.

Second, we developed a new access control mechanism for \texttt{SELECT} queries.

%This is essential to effectively secure PostgreSQL and prevent leakages of sensitive information. 
%
%In more detail we devised a new access control mechanism for \texttt{SELECT} queries.
%
Checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} queries is essential to effectively secure  PostgreSQL and prevent leakages of sensitive information. 
%
Moreover, strong access control mechanisms, such as the one proposed by Guarnieri et al., use sub-routines for checking the security of \texttt{SELECT} queries as building blocks. 
%
In contrast to the mechanism implemented in PostgreSQL, which rely on naive syntactic checks, our mechanism rely on query rewriting and query containment.
%
As a result, it is more permissive than the PostgreSQL's mechanism, while providing the same security guarantees. 
%
%Our mechanism is the first building block to successfully implement strong access control mechanisms, such as the one proposed by Guarnieri et al.

\remark{Get rid of ``will'' and just use present tense. When you start a sentence with ``In chapter X'', you should put a comma after it.}
%
In chapter 2 we will introduce a motivating example.
%
In chapter 3 we will give background information to access control by comparing current access control mechanism to the model introduced in~\cite{guarnieri2016strong}.
%
Afterwards, we will introduce the architecture of PostgreSQL and the new access control algorithm in chapter 4. 
%
In chapter 5 we will begin by showing the formal models of all aspects of the new security defintions and how they are extended from the relational algebra to SQL.  
%
In chapter 6 we will introduce some related work to the thesis. 
%
Finally, in chapter 7 the conclusions are drawn and future possibilities are discussed.
