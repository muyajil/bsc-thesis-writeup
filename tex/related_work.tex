\section{Related Work}

The algorithms devised in this thesis are based on algorithms supporting the relational calclus by Guarnier et al. In~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} they showed the rewriting algorithm, inference rules and the authorization function for queries in the relational calculus including \texttt{SELECT}.
%
In~\cite{guarnieri2014optimal} the same authors show how queries can be executed in the presence of access control policies.

Further Rizvi et al.~\cite{rizvi2004extending} have identified the Non-truman and the Truman model of access control mechanisms.

In~\cite{wang2007correctness} the authors introduced a query modification algorithm that would also be suited for the Truman model.
%
However, their algorithm will, for each query $q$ issued by user $u$ replace each piece information obtained from $q$, which is not authorized to be read by $u$ by \texttt{NULL}, instead of just not returning it to the $u$.

Further in~\cite{rizvi2004extending}.

\remark{TODO - Compare our rewriting to those in \cite{rizvi2004extending} (non-truman)}
