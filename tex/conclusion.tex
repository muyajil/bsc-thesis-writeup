\section{Conclusion}

As shown in~\cite{guarnieri2016strong} current database access control mechanisms are not secure.
%
Therefore the need for new, stronger access control mechanisms is here and database vendors need to address this fact in the future.
%
This thesis however, shows that the implementation of such mechanisms might interfere with the database internals, therefore major modifications are needed in existing DBMS such as PostgreSQL on how access control decisions are made.
%
The modifications made to the PostgreSQL internals during this thesis however prepare the implementation of new access control mechanisms by providing developers with a uniform interface and clear code segregation.
